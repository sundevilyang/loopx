# Basic usage statistics

[中文](usage-ping.zh-CN.md)

Basic usage statistics are **on by default after visible first-use disclosure**.
They help prioritize supported platforms, understand continued use and find slow
or failing CLI entry points. They are not a measurement of accepted Goal
outcomes. No content collection is implemented.

```bash
loopx usage-ping status      # current policy, recipient and outgoing payload previews
loopx usage-ping disable     # stop all channels; delete local ID and pending counts
loopx usage-ping enable      # explicitly allow all channels after reading the disclosure
```

Settings → Capability Center → Device defaults exposes the same machine-wide switch and previews.
Opening settings or running these commands never sends a measurement. Settings
are owned by the TypeScript usage-statistics module, independently of a Goal's
File/SQLite/PostgreSQL provider; Python and the browser adapt that same owner.
Lark has no separate switch and cannot override the machine owner's choice.

## Product questions and exact scope

### Device context and installation runtime (notice revision 6)

Configure once for the machine, not once per Goal or terminal:

```bash
loopx usage-ping context --context maintainer
loopx usage-ping status --format json
loopx usage-ping context --context unknown    # remove the voluntary label
```

The Workspace device settings use the same TypeScript owner. Precedence is an
explicit `LOOPX_USAGE_CONTEXT` environment value, then the stored device label,
then `unknown`. Invalid environment values remain unknown; invalid settings are
rejected. Context configuration never enables collection, changes the random
installation ID, or grants work authority. Disable retains only that optional
label, clearing identity and measurement history. No generic repository `.env`
is auto-loaded. Existing ID-free diagnostic rows remain ID-free.

The **new** `POST /v1/installation` contract,
`loopx_installation_usage_v1`, links the existing random installation ID to up
to eight UTC daily snapshots. Each has activity date, numeric version,
voluntary context, revision, fixed CLI family counts, independent observed
runtime minutes, and a truncation flag. The context and version freeze on that
day's first observation; later settings do not relabel that day or history.
Counts are capped at 10,000 per family. New diagnostics and profiles distinguish
`heartbeat`, `state`, `agent`, `memory`, `capability` and `maintenance`
families using fixed parsed command names; custom names remain `other`.
The legacy feature contract is unchanged.

For each of `host_call`, `codex_turn` and `quota_cycle`, union actual
observation intervals **across all Goals and Hosts in the same installation**.
Split at UTC midnight and round each daily union down to whole minutes.
Parallel/nested overlap counts once; replay adds nothing; inter-interval idle
time adds nothing. Runtime rows are absent when no interval was observed; a
present row with zero minutes means less than one observed minute, not no work.
Do not add the three clocks: quota/Turn intervals can include pauses, approval
and tool waits, while direct Host calls use the existing short-checkpoint gap
rules. This measures partial instrumented elapsed time, **not process uptime**,
CPU time, completion, billable time or model thinking time. A process that only
heartbeats has unknown runtime, not 24 hours/day.

Intervals remain local and bounded to 1,024 disjoint intervals per clock/day
and eight UTC days. Overflow is marked `truncated` rather than extrapolated.
Only whole-minute daily totals leave; no interval timestamps, Goal/Agent/Host
identity or transcripts. Full snapshots attempt at most every 15 minutes on
supported activity, not an autonomous timer. A quiet final partial day may
remain unsent; late observations can update the previous seven days. The
collector replaces only newer revisions for the exact installation/date and
same frozen context/version; duplicate or out-of-order transport never adds
counts. Client state loss without changing the ID can cause undercounting;
copied IDs can conflate machines. These are diagnostics, not a ledger.

Installation profiles are a **new association**, not anonymous aggregate
data. Renewed disclosure fences old workers before it begins; old scope
buffers are discarded, not backfilled. `CI`, `DO_NOT_TRACK`, explicit disable
and consent-required policy keep their precedence. Disable removes local
`.installation` interval buffers; a request already started cannot be recalled.
Collector profile retention is 30 activity days, independent of 400-day
heartbeat retention. No public endpoint exposes per-ID profiles.

Operators may sum daily observed minutes within a specified retained window
for each installation/clock, and report active days, calendar span and runtime
**separately**. This is observed time in that window, not lifetime uptime.
See [fixed read queries](../../apps/usage-collector/queries/installation-usage.sql).
Do not divide old anonymous CLI counts by ID totals or fill missing days with
zero. Excluding `maintainer` applies only to explicit future profile labels;
`unknown` does not prove external or personal use.

Deploy additive migration `0005-installation-usage.sql` and the Worker before
releasing notice-v6 clients. Validate against a disposable database/collector,
never by writing synthetic events to production. Worker rollback keeps the
additive table; older clients/endpoints remain supported. Merging does not
deploy the Worker or change installed clients.

| Question | Evidence | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| Which versions/platforms need support? | Daily version, OS, CPU architecture, Python minor and install channel | Only reporting installations |
| Do installations keep using LoopX? | Random installation ID, daily deduplication, mature 1/7/30-day return windows | Persistent state directories, not people or organizations; deleting state/re-enabling creates a new ID |
| Which CLI entry points are used? | Fixed command-family/sub-operation counters, release version and UTC activity date | Polling and automation count too; not a measure of user value |
| Which commands fail or take time? | Typed result/reason and coarse elapsed-time bucket | Merge-readiness holds are `blocked`, not failures; unclassified failures remain `command_failed` |
| Is meaningful work observed? | Receipt-backed registration, Turn commitment, Todo completion/validation and verified return | Partial transition counts, not unique Goals or independently judged quality |

The first version measures CLI invocations, including those made by agents.
Top-level `--help`/`--version` fast paths, native exec-replaced scheduler
followups, API-only interactions and individual App/Lark actions are not
instrumented. Heartbeats start in the background before dispatch; long-running server command
results are counted only when the CLI returns. There is no claim to complete product activity or task success rates.

## Separate payload contracts

**Daily heartbeat** (`POST /v1/ping`), with exactly these fields:

```json
{"schema":"loopx_usage_ping_v1","install_id":"00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001","version":"1.2.0","os":"linux","arch":"x64","python":"3.13","channel":"pip"}
```

The ID is random, local to the persistent machine-state directory and not derived
from hardware or an account. Sessions and disclosure upgrades retain it; explicit
disable deletes it. Ephemeral homes, deleted/copied state and re-enabling distort
installation counts. It enables cross-day association, so this is **not fully anonymous**.
OS is `darwin|linux|windows|other`, CPU is `x64|arm64|x86|other`, and channel is
`pip|local_release|source|unknown`. Version accepts only numeric major.minor.patch;
a custom version containing a private suffix is not sent.

**ID-free CLI diagnostics** (`POST /v1/aggregate`, introduced in notice revision 5):

```json
{"schema":"loopx_usage_diagnostics_v1","counters":[{"feature":"pr-review","operation":"merge-readiness","outcome":"blocked","error":"not_ready","duration":"lt_1s","count":4,"version":"1.2.3","activity_day":"2026-09-30","context":"unknown","signal":"none"}]}
```

The new default adds numeric release version, UTC activity **date** (not event
time), fixed sub-operation, result/reason and receipt-backed lifecycle signal.
Deployment context is optional self-report via the shared device setting or
`LOOPX_USAGE_CONTEXT` (environment takes precedence):
`unknown` (default), `personal`, `shared_service`, `ephemeral`,
`organization_managed`, `maintainer`. Invalid values become `unknown`; no
company name, person or hardware topology is inferred or sent. Set `maintainer`
on maintainer devices/processes to distinguish their **future diagnostics and
daily installation profiles** in operator analysis. It does not label the
heartbeat table or identify historical ID-free counts.
Use the shared disable switch to exclude a machine from all channels.

The collector adds a separate receipt date. It accepts activity dates from the
previous seven days through today; old/future packets are rejected. No ID, Goal
or request timestamp enters this table. Both ends share the typed schema.
Operations come from parsed command structure, never argument values:

- `turn`: `plan|run-once|status`; `quota`: `status|plan|should-run|spend-slot|monitor-poll`.
- `todo`: `list|add|claim|update|complete`.
- `project`: `register|resolve|bind-session|unbind-session`.
- `pr-review`: `merge-readiness|check-result`; other operations are `default`.
- Verified return observation uses `other/result-return`.

Results are `ok|blocked|failed|cancelled`. Reasons are
`none|not_ready|invalid_input|permission|not_found|timeout|connection|interrupted|command_failed`.
An otherwise valid merge-readiness response with `ready=false` records
`blocked/not_ready` without changing its original nonzero exit code. Errors
come from exception classes and typed booleans, never parsed error prose.

Signals are `none|project_registered|managed_turn_committed|todo_completed|todo_validated|result_returned`.
They require existing changed/committed receipts, not mere exit success. Dry
runs and unchanged Todo completion do not count; Turn replays do not pass the
existing committed-current-effects predicate. Passed completion validation is
required for `todo_validated`. Return currently covers exact-source manager-context
deliveries verified by the provider and newly settled as delivered, not legacy
or unverified paths. None of these observations changes work authority.

**Retained legacy CLI aggregate** (same endpoint):

```json
{"schema":"loopx_usage_aggregate_v1","counters":[{"feature":"todo","outcome":"ok","duration":"lt_1s","error":"none","count":4}]}
```

No installation ID, version, timestamp, Goal or other join key is included in this legacy contract.
The collector adds its reception day, merges counters, and stores no individual
request rows. Both sender and collector use the same strict TS allowlist:

- Feature: `status`, `quota`, `todo`, `turn`, `project`, `connect`, `pr-review`,
  `version`, `chat`, `other`. Unlisted commands become `other`, never raw names.
- Result: `ok`, `failed`, `cancelled`.
- Duration: `<100ms`, `100ms–<1s`, `1s–<10s`, `10s–<60s`, `≥60s`, encoded as
  `lt_100ms|lt_1s|lt_10s|lt_60s|gte_60s`. This measures command dispatch, not full
  interpreter startup or Goal duration.
- Error: `none`, `command_failed`, `timeout`, `connection`, `interrupted`.
  Typed exceptions supply categories; error messages are never parsed or sent.

No prompts, source code, paths, repositories, arguments, tool outputs, raw
errors, stack traces, Goal/Todo IDs or custom Agent/MCP names are collected.
Additional payload fields and invalid enum combinations are rejected.

## Disclosure and precedence

Interactive CLI, unattended scripts/agents and the App use the same
**first disclosure → automatic activation → subsequent measurement** policy.
The first ordinary CLI command prints the recipient, fields, purpose, CLI delivery
cadence, network timing correlation boundary and both disable mechanisms to
stderr, records the disclosure, and sends nothing.
This also applies to captured stderr in scripts and Agent tool calls; JSON
stdout is unaffected. Discarded stderr (the null device) or a failed write
cannot acknowledge a notice. Background `chat`/`serve-status` services defer
first disclosure to the App instead of treating a service log as the App UI.

On first opening the live App, a visible notice explains the collection and
recipient, with **Turn off**, **Details** and **Dismiss** controls. After the
notice paints in a visible tab, the App records the same acknowledgment as CLI;
no enable click or visit to settings is needed. A hidden tab, read-only shared
view, unavailable settings service or status read alone does not acknowledge it.
Acknowledgment itself never sends a measurement. Later supported activity may
measure/send; individual App clicks remain outside the collection scope.
Settings → Capability Center keeps the shared switch and payload previews.

This changes the previous unattended CLI and App defaults: unattended CLI no
longer requires explicit enable, and the App no longer requires a first-use
enable button under the default `opt_out` policy. Environment overrides and
`consent_required` retain their precedence.
Previously enabled v0 clients keep their random ID
but must see the expanded-scope disclosure; previously disabled clients stay off.

An explicit stored disable blocks all channels. The following environment
settings also block all channels, even after explicit enable:

- `LOOPX_USAGE_PING=0|false|no|off`
- `DO_NOT_TRACK` set to a nonempty value other than `0`
- `CI` set to a nonempty value other than `0|false`

Project Python CI and public smoke workflows explicitly set `LOOPX_USAGE_PING=0`.
Pytest and the canary smoke runner also disable collection for local validation.
Native Codex benchmark profiles force the same opt-out during installation,
runtime and Agent shell execution, even when a minimal environment removes `CI`
or the parent requests collection. Release qualification uses the same boundary.
These synthetic runs must not count as reporting installations. Telemetry tests
may explicitly enable collection only against a disposable local collector.

`LOOPX_USAGE_POLICY=consent_required` requires explicit enable; merely displaying
the notice is insufficient. Default policy is `opt_out`; unknown policies fail
closed. Distribution owners must choose the applicable policy before shipping;
this switch does not itself determine legal compliance, infer region from IP,
or replace any applicable consent requirement.

The project endpoint is
`https://loopx-usage-collector.huangrt01.workers.dev/v1/ping`.
`LOOPX_USAGE_PING_ENDPOINT` may override it with an HTTPS `/v1/ping` URL (HTTP is
allowed only on loopback for testing). Credentials, queries and fragments are
rejected. The aggregate destination is the same origin's sibling `/v1/aggregate`.
Recipient/policy changes invalidate the prior disclosure; explicit enable
confirms the new selection. Switching recipients clears buffered counts and
rotates the ID. Redirects are never followed.

## Delivery, local state and withdrawal

Fresh installations keep machine-local state in `~/.loopx/usage-ping.json`,
mode `0600`. An existing default global registry under `.codex/loopx` keeps
that machine's usage state on the legacy route until explicit local-state
migration. Two default registries reject implicit settings writes. The route
is independent of a Goal runtime root. It is not copied into Goal state,
backups of authority providers, or public projections. Normal
CLI invocation reads only a small local hint; a detached Node process owns
measurement, locks and network I/O. A first-use/settings operation may wait for
local Node execution, never for a collector connection.
Offline `migrate-local-state` commands do not schedule these observations,
because their previews and rollback receipts bind the machine-state bytes.

Each installation attempts at most one heartbeat per UTC day. The first measured
CLI result attempts an aggregate send immediately, including a failed result.
Later eligible activity sends buffered deltas at most once every 15 minutes;
UTC midnight does not reset that interval. Heartbeats and CLI batches have
independent claims, so a heartbeat attempt cannot suppress a completed result.
Startup alone never invents a result. Settings/status operations never flush.
This replaces next-day-only CLI delivery for enabled installations across
interactive and unattended CLI lanes; Goal-duration snapshots remain daily.

Legacy counts are capped at 128 distinct rows; new diagnostics at 32, with
10,000 per row. Diagnostics expire by activity date after seven UTC days;
legacy expiry uses the oldest buffered day. Overflow records a bounded local
`diagnostic_dropped` count, not an unbounded queue. Existing buffers remain
readable. The current notice revision 6 renews disclosure before the expanded default takes
effect: old notice state cannot send or consume buffers.
Acknowledging the renewed notice discards old-scope counters and fences queued
observations with a new generation; only subsequent measurements can send.
Explicit disable remains disabled, and acknowledgment cannot replace explicit
enable under `consent_required`. Each batch is removed and its attempt time
persisted before the request starts under the same short lock; network waiting
happens after release. Attempts are spaced even on failure or clock rollback.
There are no immediate retries, background timers or durable network queues.
A session that stops within the interval can still lose its unsent tail; this
reduces dependence on next-day return without promising complete coverage.
Lock contention, crashes and failed requests can also lose counts. These are
**lossy diagnostics**, not billing or audit records.

Current diagnostics contain version/activity date, but no installation ID or
event time. Historical legacy counts have neither version nor activity date
and cannot be retrospectively reattributed. Do not divide either channel's
totals by reporting installations to infer per-install usage. More frequent requests can make
network timing correlation easier; identity-free payloads do not prevent that.

Requests have a three-second deadline, do not block command completion, and
cannot change its output or exit code. They use the supported Node runtime's
`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` settings; proxy addresses and credentials
never enter telemetry payloads. Disable deletes the local ID and buffered
counts; an old worker cannot restore them or send the next channel. A request
already handed to the network cannot be recalled. Re-enable uses a new ID.
Corrupt or unsupported state fails closed; explicit disable is the repair path.
Status/Settings show at most 20 local delivery summaries (UTC date, channel,
row count, accepted/rejected/unavailable). No request bodies, errors or URLs
enter this journal. Disable erases it. HTTP acceptance does not prove durable
collector storage or work acceptance; an unsent preview is not a receipt.

## Collector and interpretation

[Collector source and upgrade instructions](../../apps/usage-collector/README.md).
Heartbeat history is retained for 400 days; aggregated counters for 30 days.
The existing `/v0/stats` endpoint continues to report deduplicated installations
from old and new heartbeat clients. `/v1/aggregate-stats` publishes independent
feature/result/duration/error totals, omitting cells below five. It does not
publish cross-dimensional combinations or per-install behavior histories.
`/v1/diagnostic-stats` publishes independent 30-receipt-day marginals for feature,
operation, result, reason, duration, version, context and signal, suppressing
cells below five. Operator-only queries may exclude `context='maintainer'` and
compare activity/receipt dates; those counts still cannot join installations.
Apply additive migration `0004-diagnostics.sql` and deploy the collector before
releasing notice-v5 clients. An older Worker rejects new packets lossily;
retain the table on rollback. No historical diagnostic rows are invented.

`/v1/adoption-stats` uses existing heartbeat data: each 1/7/30-day cohort includes
30 first-seen UTC dates whose full horizon has elapsed. Return means any later
heartbeat **within** that horizon, not exact day-N retention. It also publishes
30-day active-day buckets. Small cohorts are suppressed; the windows overlap
and are not additive. Many installations or high activity do not prove
enterprise adoption, distinct people or a paid customer.

Application code stores no client IP, user agent or Cloudflare request metadata;
Worker observability is disabled in the deployment template. Network providers
still handle connection metadata: separating bodies does not guarantee that
requests can never be correlated. Public unauthenticated counters can be
inflated, and suppression/loss makes these estimates unsuitable for billing.
The service may be unreachable on some networks; the owner can supply a reachable
collector, and LoopX continues to work without telemetry.

## Observed Goal duration

Goal timing answers whether observed work continues across hours or days. It
reports three **independent populations**; never add their durations or counts:

| Measurement | Boundary and coverage | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quota_cycle` | Every Host using the shared quota CLI: first allowed `should-run` to successful executed `spend-slot`, including Codex App | Coarse progression time, including intervening pauses and waits |
| `codex_turn` | Exact accepted Codex task binding, timing events in that selected local Codex home | Finer execution intervals, including tool and approval waits |
| `host_call` | Managed `turn run-once` and regular owner Goal chat around actual Host invocation | Directly instrumented call intervals, including network/tool waits |

Repeated allowed quota reads preserve the first start. Denial, spend preview,
failed settlement and receipt repair do not finish a cycle. Successful settlement
replays emit no new timing marker and cannot extend its end. Exact Turn identity separates concurrent cycles;
without one, only a single inferred cycle per Goal/agent lane is measured. This
fallback cannot distinguish concurrent unbound cycles. Missing spend produces no
finished interval. These are diagnostic observations, never quota authority.

Codex discovery uses accepted Goal/agent/task bindings and the selected
`CODEX_HOME` read-only metadata database. It does not search other homes or infer
ownership from cwd. Timing extraction runs in detached processes triggered by
quota observations. It reads at most 1 MiB of new JSONL per observation (the tail
on first discovery), retains only timing cursors and open Turn identity locally,
and never uploads transcript content. A terminal written after spend is picked
up on a later observation; this is not a global session watcher. Missing or
ambiguous bindings and unavailable files leave the common quota cycle working.
No historical backfill or extrapolation of crashed sessions occurs.

Codex provider `started_at`/`completed_at` values accept Unix seconds or legacy
ISO dates. Explicit provider times take precedence over the recorder timestamp;
without an explicit start, a terminal must match the observed open Turn. Only
completed or aborted Turns produce intervals. `token_count` record timestamps
may be delayed beyond the provider's completion, so they no longer extend an
unfinished Turn. An ongoing native session can report its completed Turns, but
its current unfinished Turn remains unknown until a terminal is read. This
corrects prior prefix timing; it does not rewrite previously sent aggregates.

These populations have no enforced size ordering. A quota cycle commonly
encloses several Turns and waits; a managed Host call can enclose a Turn plus
startup/cleanup. Native sessions, incomplete cycles and coverage gaps can reverse
their observed totals. Compare each clock over the same window and inspect
coverage rather than assuming `host_call <= codex_turn <= quota_cycle`.

Within each Goal/measurement/Host series, **span** is first to most recent
observed activity, including pauses; **duration** is the union of observed
intervals. Parallel or nested overlap counts once within that series. Both stop
growing without new evidence. They are not Goal age, CPU time, completion or
billing evidence. Fixed Host labels are `codex_app`, `codex_cli`, `claude_code`,
`dsh`, `opencode`, `trae`, `kiro_cli`, `other`, `unknown`; custom names never go on
the wire. A new label is accepted only by a collector built from the same
contract, so deploy the collector before releasing a client that emits it.

One cumulative snapshot per observed series/UTC day is claimed after that day
closes, when another observation or normal usage occurs. Unfinished Goals count;
quiet Goals are not counted daily. Managed Host calls checkpoint every minute.
Counts are **Goal/measurement/Host-day observations**, not unique Goals or users.
The collector cannot join a Goal across days or machines.

The observer is independent of File/SQLite/PostgreSQL state ownership and never
changes authority state. Collection starts after notice acknowledgment. Disable,
recipient changes or clearing local state restart measurement. Crashes, missing
checkpoints, contention, offline collectors and limits can lose observations;
these are partial measurements, not a complete execution accounting system.
Local limits are 64 series, 512 recent disjoint intervals per series, 128 cycles,
64 Codex cursors. Closed cycles and least-recently-read cursors yield capacity to
new work; inactive cursors expire after seven days. Intervals older than 14 days compact into totals; series expire
after 90 inactive days. Observations may arrive seven days late; coarse/fine
intervals longer than seven days are discarded. Direct Host checkpoints longer
than two minutes are discarded as unproven scheduling suspension. Unsent daily
snapshots expire after seven days. No retries require an outgoing identity.

The outgoing Goal payload is strictly allowlisted:

```json
{"schema":"loopx_goal_usage_aggregate_v1","counters":[{"measurement":"quota_cycle","host":"codex_app","span":"lt_7d","duration":"lt_6h","count":1}]}
```

Both durations use `lt_1m`, `lt_10m`, `lt_1h`, `lt_6h`, `lt_1d`, `lt_7d`,
`lt_30d`, `gte_30d`. No Goal ID, installation ID, path, name, event time or free
text is sent. `/v1/goals` ingests counts; `/v1/goal-stats` returns separate
measurement histograms over 30 receipt days, omitting cells below five.

The existing settings switch, environment opt-outs and consent policy control
all channels and local timing reads. Settings and `loopx usage-ping status`
show `goal_preview`, a local snapshot rather than a delivery receipt. Expanded
scope requires the current notice version 6; an existing explicit disable persists.

Before shipping the client, back up D1, apply `0002-goal-usage.sql` and
`0003-goal-duration-sources.sql`, then deploy the Worker. The latter migrates
previous Goal counts into `host_call`/`unknown` without deleting the old table;
existing heartbeat and CLI counts remain intact. The unreleased Goal v1 payload
now requires measurement/Host labels and `duration` in place of `execution`.
