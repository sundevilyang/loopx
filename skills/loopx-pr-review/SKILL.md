description: Use for `/loopx-pr-review` or evidence-backed PR queue review. Run `loopx pr-review` first, execute the capability-owned review plan for each selected exact head, then publish full bilingual PR reviews (complete Chinese five-block review plus one concise English verdict) that match the verified findings. Use `loopx-pr-merge` for approval or merge actions.

# LoopX PR Review

This skill is a thin host adapter. The built-in `pull-request-review`
capability owns review depth, evidence requirements, completeness, and verdict
policy through the CLI packet. Do not copy those rules into this skill or
replace them with a host-specific checklist.

## Route

Use this skill for `/loopx-pr-review`, explicit PR reviews, or review queues by
state or time window. Route approval, merge, self-merge, and admin bypass to
`loopx-pr-merge` (optional repo-kept workflow, not installed by default) after
the evidence review is complete; it never replaces this skill's exact-head gate.

For named PRs, resolve heads and run repeatable `--target-exact-head NUMBER@HEAD_OID`. An omitted `--state` keeps ordinary queue discovery open-only while exact targets remain lifecycle-neutral; use explicit `--state merged|all` only for deliberate history or post-merge audit.

Translate only explicit filters:

- `--repo owner/repo`
- `--since ISO`
- `--state open|merged|all`
- `--limit N`; `--target-exact-head NUMBER@HEAD_OID` (repeatable direct read)
- `--review-priority other-developers-first|owner-first` (default `other-developers-first`; use `owner-first` to opt into owner priority)
When omitted, the CLI resolves `pull_request_review` from the standard machine
capability editor; an absent namespace keeps the default `other-developers-first`.
Words such as `today`, `open`, or `merged` are filters, not permission to return a
table only; stats-only output needs an explicit opt-out such as `只统计` or `stats only`.

## Preserve The Packet

Save the full first JSON packet before printing a compact projection. Keep all
paths named by `agent_response_contract.required_packet_fields_to_preserve`:

- `agent_response_contract.review_execution_contract`
- `result_completeness`, `scheduling_policy`, `review_groups`
- `pull_requests[review_action_kind!=null].review_plan`
- `pull_requests[review_action_kind!=null].review_template`
- `pull_requests[review_action_kind!=null].evidence_commands`

Do not pipe the only copy through `jq`. When an exhaustive queue request has
`result_completeness.complete=false`, rerun with its `recommended_limit` before
reviewing; `limit_scope=exact_targets` is already complete for the named targets.

Read `review_execution_contract.policy_revision` from the packet; require the result's
`review_policy_revision` to equal it, never a literal this file pins. If missing or unequal,
do not publish APPROVE; a conservative REQUEST_CHANGES is allowed only when it names the
incompatible-policy gap. Do not retain expired temporary worktree overrides. Report
incompatible policy rather than downgrading the review.

## Read The Review Frame First

Read the PR's existing comments and cited documents first: a maintainer comment
names the contract the change is judged against.

- Review inside that frame; cite the document and check its rows, gates, or exit criteria one by one at the exact head, attaching each finding to its row.
- Name unsatisfied rows as missing frame items with their own evidence; keep the declared boundary (preview versus promotion, milestone entry versus merge).
- Publish the frame-aligned conclusion as a PR comment citing that guidance, since a published review body cannot be edited.

## Execute One Review Plan

Follow `scheduling_policy` and its ranked actionable `review_sequence`; explicit current-request PR selection may override ordering only, never `pull_requests[].review_action_kind` or exact-head idempotency. Generic `re-review`, `重新review`, and `复审` wording selects the named PR; it is not a force-refresh token. Todo/monitor prose may not select work.
When `review_action_kind` is null, the row stays in `pull_requests` inventory but must not appear in `review_sequence`; its `review_plan` and `review_template` are null and `evidence_commands` is empty. Do one compact exact-head conclusion readback and report the existing verdict or bounded invalid/missing reason. Run a fresh audit only when the user explicitly requests fresh evidence despite that result, or supplies a concrete new concern; regenerate with `--fresh-audit-exact-head NUMBER@HEAD_OID`, then execute the complete current plan and never inherit the earlier approval. For every actionable PR:

1. Record the packet's exact head, then follow `review_execution_contract.decision_procedure`:
   the current goal and `problem_context` delivery judgment first, including on re-review,
   then `evidence_commands` and repository-native validation.
2. Fill `review_plan.result_template`; preserve missing evidence as `unverified` and never
   infer `verified` from metadata or CI. Execute its repository-reuse, default-off, authority
   and real-path counterfactuals rather than repeating them as prose. Fill `result.reviewer`
   per `review_execution_contract.reviewer_declaration`, open the body with its `body_marker`
   line, and read `problem_context.spec_basis`'s specification before the diff.
3. Apply `completion_gate` literally: save final Markdown in `review_body`, then check
   evidence and that exact body. Follow capability-owned floors and scope counterfactuals;
   prose cannot replace missing execution:

   ```bash
   loopx --format json pr-review --check-result review-result.json --packet review-packet.json
   ```

   Fix contradictory verdicts, not evidence labels. It cannot verify evidence truth,
   architecture, freshness or a relabeled old result.
4. Publish the checked `review_body`; recheck after edits. Replace `result.review_body`
   with the remote readback and rerun `--check-result`; matching does not certify reasoning.
5. Re-read the remote head immediately before verdict and publication; restart evidence if it changed.

Each PR needs independent evidence and a standalone card; a queue table is a preface only.

For managed review, pass `--goal-id GOAL` and follow the packet’s resolved `wait_for_ci`: false means never fetch, poll, or wait for CI; true retains CI observation. Apply the packet's `validation_matrix.failure_attribution` before treating a red required check as a PR blocker. An independently verified unchanged baseline failure or external outage can hold merge readiness without forcing `REQUEST_CHANGES` on an unrelated PR; missing attribution or missing affected-invariant coverage still blocks approval. Configure one Goal with `configure-goal --goal-id GOAL --no-pr-review-wait-for-ci --execute`; clear with `--clear-pr-review-configuration --execute`.

## Publish And Read Back
For an open PR, publish validated actionable findings by default unless the user
requested local-only/dry-run output or the finding is private or security-sensitive.

- Remaining blocker: formal `REQUEST_CHANGES`; for an author-owned PR, use a
  `COMMENTED` review titled `Request changes conclusion (author-owned PR; GitHub blocks formal self-review)`.
- Non-blocking finding with no blockers: formal `APPROVE`, not a bare comment;
  when the account is the author and self-approval is rejected, record the same
  conclusion as a `COMMENTED` review titled `Approval conclusion (author-owned PR; GitHub blocks formal self-approval)`.
- Non-blocking P2 suggestions: still `APPROVE`; keep them in the body.
- Merged PR: publish a post-merge audit comment only for a new actionable finding;
  avoid duplicating an equivalent exact-head result.

Build public text from the exact reviewed head; remove local paths, private context, raw
logs, credentials and internal-only links. Read the published review back, verify state/body
and return its URL. After APPROVE (incl. existing approval), execute
`review_execution_contract.approval_closeout`; reconcile only verified obsolete blockers with
owner/GitHub authority, preserving discussion and unresolved reviews. Merge routes through
`loopx-pr-merge`; `APPROVE` is not merge authority; a public blocker belongs on the PR.

Immediately before every merge, run `loopx --format json pr-review --goal-id GOAL
--repo OWNER/REPO --check-merge-readiness NUMBER@HEAD_OID`; require `ready=true`. Its compact
Goal observation suppresses only unchanged requalification; material change reopens it, admin
bypass never overrides this gate, and author fallback needs user authority.

## Full PR Review And Bilingual Format

Every review must cover the whole PR, not only the top finding: read the full diff/local
validation, then explain motivation, architecture, changed symbols, both paths, whole-diff
risk, validation, and judgment. A findings-only or blocker-only body is incomplete.

Publish two artifacts:

1. **详细中文评审** - a standalone Chinese full-PR review with the exact head and five
   sections: `动机`, `改动思路`, `具体改动`, `对主干的风险`, `我的整体评价`. Cover every
   changed surface and key symbols, not only the main finding.
2. **审查者来源** - one visible `body_marker` line naming the actor kind and, for an
   agent, the model and provider. It must agree with `result.reviewer`; a reviewer
   from another operator reads this body, not your local result.
3. **英文简短结论** - a line starting with exactly `English verdict:` followed by the bare
   token `APPROVE` or `REQUEST_CHANGES`, then the head, key finding, and validation. The
   parser matches that token as a keyword, so `English verdict: Approved at ...` is invalid
   and leaves the head without a merge-ready approval; write `English verdict: APPROVE - ...`.

Do not publish before the Chinese section covers the entire PR. Follow the packet's `problem_context` publication rule for an understandable opening. Read both artifacts back.

## Example / Walkthrough / Smoke-Only PRs

When the review plan marks `smoke_or_example_only`, the `durable_smoke_value`
evidence is mandatory before approval. The essence is real, durable value to
the repository and product: running, deterministic, and public-safe are
necessary but not enough.

1. Name the shipped behavior, boundary, or maintenance cost this artifact
   guards. "Demonstrates something that already works" is not durable value.
2. Scan existing coverage (`rg -l '<behavior|module>' examples tests`) and the
   same-author batch (`gh pr list ... --author <author>` / `gh search prs`);
   flag same-shape batches opened within minutes as PR farming.
3. Apply the repo smoke policy: thin + durable, guard shipped behavior or a
   real boundary, compress rather than append, consolidate same-shape
   walkthroughs into one PR or focused tests.
4. Verdict: `REQUEST_CHANGES` for duplicative, oversized, or value-less
   scaffolding; name the consolidation or thinning repair in the body.
5. Repeat offenders: after a REQUEST_CHANGES warning, further low-value
   same-shape PRs from the same author escalate to a contribution-restriction
   recommendation (owner blocks the account from further PR submissions); the
   warning must name this consequence.

## Autonomous Queue

For recurring observation, keep one ignored checkpoint and use `loopx --format
json pr-review --repo owner/repo --state open --autonomous-observation
--observation-state-file .local/pr-review-monitor.json` with the projected or handled
exact-head flags when those durable receipts exist.

Treat `candidate` as a preview, not a durable projection. Follow this order: durable
Todo target-key readback -> `--projected-exact-head` -> exact-head review/comment
readback -> `--handled-exact-head`. Never send the projection ACK before the Todo
exists, or the handled ACK before readback at that head. Observation states remain literal;
the checkpoint grants no authority. Stateless callers may use `--previous-observation-json` instead.

## Failure

If `loopx pr-review` is unavailable, repair the LoopX install or use the
intended checked-out CLI. Do not reconstruct the queue manually and call it a
successful `/loopx-pr-review` run.
