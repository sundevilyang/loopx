"""One shared fresh Turn decision for every Turn subcommand that needs one.

``run-once`` and ``managed-step`` must agree on what "the current governing
decision" means: read the same live status, apply the same controller advisory
primary, and sign the same ``loopx_turn_envelope_v0``. Duplicating that chain
would let the two drift, so both owners build through this module.

The owner carries the inputs the decision was derived from as well, because a
Turn that later spends quota or re-checks the scheduler must use the same live
status, the same scheduler context and the same activation-bound capability
hooks as the decision it already took. A call site that re-derives one of those
inputs is free to drift from the decision it is settling.

Nothing here executes, writes, or spends: it only projects the control plane's
current decision into the envelope the loop controller consumes.
